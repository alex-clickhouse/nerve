"""Config-bundle validation for CI and ``nerve config validate``.

Validates the merged configuration the way :func:`nerve.config.load_config`
assembles it (workspace/config/settings.yaml + config.yaml + config.local.yaml),
but **leniently** with respect to secrets: ``${ENV_VAR}`` references that are
unset are treated as valid placeholders (they aren't present in CI) rather than
hard failures — unless ``strict_env`` is requested.

Structural problems are hard errors so a bad config PR fails CI before merge: an
unparseable or invalid cron file, a bad backend / codex config, a malformed cron
gate spec, a schedule the scheduler will not run as written
(:func:`_schedule_problem`), or a path setting left blank — which is not "unset"
but the daemon's working directory (:data:`_WORKING_DIR_PATH_KEYS`). Unknown /
misspelled top-level keys are warnings by default (a config carrying a key from
a newer nerve, or the shipped example, shouldn't fail CI) — pass ``strict_keys``
to promote them to errors.

**Validation never loads the bundle's own code.** Cron gate plugins are ordinary
``.py`` files that the daemon imports at startup; importing one to check it would
mean the bundle had already executed by the time we decided it was unfit — "an
invalid bundle is refused" is not a guarantee you can make about code you had to
run to judge. So validation does not load them at all, and it does not try to
divine what they declare either: a gate type it doesn't recognize is reported as
unverified, not accepted and not rejected. A plugin is code, and code is checked
by running it — that is the author's job, not the config validator's.

Built-in gate specs *are* built (``build_gate``), which runs nerve's own
``from_config`` with values from the bundle. That is what type-checking a gate
spec means; those three bodies parse their arguments and have no side effects.

    """Why the daemon would not run *schedule* as its author wrote it.

    Asked of the scheduler's own parser rather than re-derived here: a
    validator that disagrees with the daemon is worse than no validator,
    because it either fails configs that work or passes configs that don't.

    Two distinct mistakes, both silent without this check:

    * a 5-field crontab the scheduler rejects (``"99 * * * *"``) — the daemon
      does refuse to schedule that job, but only once the change has merged
      and synced, and only into a log line, with the instance left on its old
      config until someone reads it;
    * a string that is neither a crontab nor an interval (``"hourly"``,
      ``"@daily"``) — nothing complains about this one *ever*: it falls back
      to a fixed default and the job runs happily on a cadence nobody chose.

    Both are hard errors. Unlike an unknown config key, there is no
    forward-compatibility case to protect: the accepted schedule forms are
    read out of the scheduler code this validator is importing, so if nerve
    learns a new one the answer here changes with it. And nothing the daemon
    would honour is flagged — every schedule that yields the cadence its
    author asked for either parses as a crontab or carries an h/m/s token.
