# --- Multi-source config resolution ----------------------------------------- #

#      portable surface synced from a remote workspace repo)
#   2. config.yaml                     — machine-local base (the historical file)
#   3. config.local.yaml               — machine-local secrets / overrides
#
# ${ENV_VAR} interpolation is applied once at the end. This keeps existing
# single-file installs working unchanged (layer 1 absent → prior behavior) while
# letting shared settings live in the workspace. Lockdown mode (a later story)
# will drop layers 2/3 so only the tracked workspace layer applies.


def _read_yaml_mapping(path: Path, *, strict: bool = False) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Read a YAML file into a dict; ``{}`` if absent or empty.

    ``strict`` controls what happens when the file parses to something that
    isn't a mapping — a list, a bare string, a number. Without it the file is
    ignored with a warning, which is a bad failure mode for a config layer:
    every key it was supposed to supply silently reverts to whatever the lower
    layers said, and validation reports the bundle as fine. A truncated write,
    a `yq` mishap, or a merge conflict resolved into a sequence all produce
    exactly this shape.

    An *empty* file (or one that is nothing but comments) still yields ``{}``
    in both modes — the shipped ``settings.yaml`` scaffold is all comments and
    parses to ``None``, so treating that as an error would break every fresh
    install.

    Every way this can fail is raised as :class:`ConfigError` rather than
    escaping as a parser or OS exception, so the callers that route around a
    broken config (``nerve doctor``, ``config validate``, the reload paths) can
    report it instead of showing a traceback. That includes the file being
    unreadable: a mode-600 file owned by another user, or one deleted between
    the ``exists()`` check and the open, is a config problem like any other and
    deserves the same one-line message naming the path and the reason.

    The content is decoded as UTF-8 rather than in whatever encoding the locale
    implies. The daemon usually runs under a service manager with ``LC_ALL=C``,
    where the interpreter's default is ASCII unless it manages to coerce the
    locale to C.UTF-8 — so on a box that lacks that locale, a settings file with
    an accent in a name or a prompt hint refuses to load under the service
    manager and loads fine from an interactive shell, which is a miserable thing
    to debug. YAML is UTF-8 by spec, so pinning it is also the correct reading
