"""One-time migration of legacy config into the git-syncable workspace subtree.

Moves an existing install from the pre-refactor layout:

    <config_dir>/config.yaml            (shareable + secrets, gitignored)
    <config_dir>/config.local.yaml      (secrets, gitignored)
    ~/.nerve/cron/{jobs,system}.yaml    (cron config)

to the workspace-centric layout:

    <workspace>/config/settings.yaml    (shareable, git-tracked — SCRUBBED)
    <config_dir>/config.local.yaml      (secrets, machine-local)
    <workspace>/config/cron/*           (cron config, git-tracked)

Design (confirmed with the user):

* **Auto on upgrade / daemon start**, via :func:`maybe_migrate` — idempotent,
  a no-op once migrated. Also exposed as ``nerve migrate [--dry-run]``.
* **Only a legacy monolith is migrated.** A ``config.yaml`` holding nothing but
  the keys the split layout keeps machine-local is left exactly where it is,
  however empty the workspace's ``settings.yaml`` looks — see
  :func:`_has_portable_content`.
* **Copy + keep as backup** — originals are never deleted; ``config.yaml`` and
  the legacy cron files are renamed to ``*.migrated`` breadcrumbs, and the new
  location wins. An existing breadcrumb is never overwritten.
* **Auto-scrub secrets** — before writing the *tracked* ``settings.yaml``, secret
  values are moved into machine-local ``config.local.yaml`` and replaced with
  ``${ENV_VAR}`` placeholders. Scrubbed: values under secret-looking keys
  (see :data:`_SECRET_KEY_RE`), values whose *shape* is a credential whatever the
  key is called (``sk-…``, ``ghp_…``, ``user:pass@host``, ``?token=…``), *every*
  value inside ``env`` / ``headers`` mappings (where arbitrarily-named secrets
  live, e.g. MCP ``Authorization`` headers), and secrets nested inside lists.
  Migration prints exactly what it moved, plus anything left behind that still
  looks credential-shaped; heuristics can't be exhaustive, so **review
  settings.yaml before committing**.

Never destructive and never raises out of :func:`maybe_migrate` (best-effort on
startup).

**Isolating a migration.** Three roots are read and written, and only two of
them are obvious from the call:

* ``config_dir`` — the first argument.
* the workspace — the ``workspace`` argument; when omitted it is resolved from
  the machine-local config files, falling back to ``paths.default_workspace()``.
* the legacy cron directory — the ``legacy_cron_dir`` argument; when omitted it
  is ``paths.cron_dir()``, i.e. under ``NERVE_HOME``.

Passing ``workspace=`` alone therefore does **not** sandbox anything: the cron
half still reads, copies and *renames* files under the real state directory.
Callers that must not touch the machine — tests, tooling, a dry run against
someone else's tree — have to pass ``legacy_cron_dir=`` as well (or set
``NERVE_HOME``).
